# Task 1: Checking the Leap Year Condition

## Definition
A leap year is a year that meets the following conditions:
- It is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100,  
  **or**  
- It is divisible by 400.

---

## Steps

1. **Describe the algorithm using a step-by-step list.**

---

## Block Diagram
- **Create a flowchart to check the leap year condition:**
  - Input: An integer representing the year.
  - Output: Information about whether the given year is a leap year or not.
  - **Note:** Use arithmetic expressions and the `mod` function to calculate the remainder of division.

## Testing the Algorithm

1. **Analyze the problem.**
   - Understand the leap year rules and how they apply to different cases.
   
2. **Develop test scenarios.**
   - Select representative year values to check the algorithm's correctness.
3. **Perform the test for the selected values.**
   - Check if the algorithm correctly identifies leap years and non-leap years for all test cases.
