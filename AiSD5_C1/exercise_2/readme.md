# Task 2: Calculating the sum of digits of an integer

---

1. Draw a block diagram of the algorithm for calculating the sum of digits of an integer
* Draw a block diagram of the algorithm for calculating the sum of digits of an integer.
* The input parameter is an integer.
* The result of the algorithm is a number that is the sum of digits of an integer.


> Example:
> For the number 258, the sum of the digits is 2+5+8=15.

Warning:
* In the flowchart, use arithmetic expressions
* Use the mod operator to calculate the remainder of a division.
* Use the div operator to divide integers

2. Perform an algorithm validity test
* Conduct an analysis of the issue
* Develop test scenarios and select sample values for which you will check the
correctness of the algorithm through the test.
* Perform the test for the selected test values
